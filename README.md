# Bizops
Some small business operation scripts that I have done during my internship. Some of it was vibe-coded, therefore the initial version is very "unclean". Will clean it up when I have time in the future.

# PythonTextJoin.LongScript
Textjoins a column of alphanumeric entities with commas in between, and return it to your dashboard(Copied it for you). Simply press Ctrl + V to paste it.
Best use case is when the column is too long to use "=TEXTJOIN(...)" in excel.

# Parserr6v2
Parses a JSON object of a typical survey, and returns a csv file. The JSON format of the survey should have a question code, and then its nested dictionary.
